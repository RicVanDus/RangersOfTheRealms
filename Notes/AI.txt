Every AI:

	- Recalculate Target prio after each attack

	- Take target that is in LOS.
	- If multiple targets in LOS: check distance and damage history
	- Damage history constantly evaporates, but calculation works with the distance of the target
		So a target that did no damage, but is close might still be prio'ed above a target that low damaged the AI, but is very far away. 

	- if no target is in LOS: seek target with damage history
	- if no target is in LOS & damage history list is empty: go back to idle position


Bonus:
	- ability to 'hear'. Sets a target when hearing enough (by distance and kind of sound, footsteps right behind or a big blast somewhat away)
	- including other AI's in the target list when they damage eachother by accident



Grunt:

	- Target if out of sight: leak points
	-
