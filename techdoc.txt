- player model
	* using blend shapes as animations
		array of key names per animation
		
		key09 - weight 1 - 0 (-1)
		key01 - weight 0 - 1
		* speed modifier


- targeting

	EnemyManager: keeps array of enemies present in the level
	Player: uses array to check for angle and range. 


- armor sets
	
	Color coded. Maybe even have special shader effects?



Idea:

	Call attack on a certain blend anim key (instead of time) then sound cue and animation always matches the attack speed (alter animation speed for faster guns for example).
